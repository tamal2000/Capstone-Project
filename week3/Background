Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighbourhoods
Finding Apartment in Utrecht, NL

Background:
 
I have recently moved to Utrecht, Netherlands for my higher studies. Utrecht is a very beautiful and nice city in Netherland which is only 20 minutes intercity train ride away from Amsterdam. As Amsterdam is one of the most visited cities of the world by the tourists, the inhabitant of the Netherlands likes to stay away from the busy city centre and live in a quieter and peaceful place like Utecht. Not only the commute to Utrecht from most of the major cities is very good, but the city is also very popular for different cultural activates, events, University parks, bars and restaurants. As a result, the demand for an apartment rental is very high in Utrecht.
  
A large number of expats and locals are always looking for suitable housing in Utrecht. The target of this project will help all the apartment hunters to find a suitable apartment or house to stay based on their preference, facilities of the neighbourhood and budget based on data-driven analysis. 

At a glance a target audience will able to get benefited from the below feature of this project:

Personally, I was very lucky to find an apartment in the heart of Utrecht city centre. But it took me around three months to find a decent place for living. Although I really like the location of my apartment, the price I am currently paying feels really high considering the size of the place. So, this data-driven analysis to help me find a suitable rental apartment in the city so that I can compare with the current location and decide if I should move to a different location or not.
